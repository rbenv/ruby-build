== Name

ruby-build - Download, compile, and install a version of Ruby

== Synopsis

ruby-build [-dvpk] _<definition>_ _<prefix>_ [-- _<configure-args>_...] +
ruby-build {--list|--definitions} +
ruby-build --version

== Description

ruby-build downloads, compiles, and installs a Ruby version named by the
_definition_ argument into the location specified by _prefix_.

The _definition_ argument can optionally start with "ruby-", in which case
it resolves to a CRuby that matches the version number that follows.

The _definition_ argument can be a path to a file on disk, in which case
it is sourced into ruby-build as a bash script.

Optionally, extra Ruby _configure-args_ may be listed after "--" and
will get forwarded to the `./configure` invocation.

By default, all compile output is redirected to a log file at
`$TMPDIR/ruby-build.*.log`. Activate the verbose mode to skip the log file
and print everything to standard streams.

== Options

*-l, --list*::
  List latest stable releases for each Ruby

*--definitions*::
  List all local definitions, including outdated ones

*--version*::
  Show version of ruby-build

*-d, --dir*::
  Install the Ruby in the _prefix/definition_ destination instead of directly in _prefix_

*-v, --verbose*::
  Verbose mode: forward all build output to stdout/stderr

*-p, --patch*::
  Apply a patch from stdin before building

*-k, --keep*::
  Do not remove source tree after installation

*-4, --ipv4*::
  Resolve names to IPv4 addresses only

*-6, --ipv6*::
  Resolve names to IPv6 addresses only

== Examples

Install a Ruby version while tweaking some configuration options:
----
$ ruby-build 3.2.2 /path/to/destination -- --disable-install-doc --with-openssl-dir=/opt/openssl
----

Install a Ruby version to `~/.rubies/ruby-3.2.2`:
----
$ ruby-build --dir ruby-3.2.2 ~/.rubies
----

Install a Ruby version to `~/.rbenv/versions/3.3.5`:
----
$ ruby-build --dir 3.3.5 ~/.rbenv/versions
----

Usage as rbenv plugin, accomplishes the same as the previous example:
----
$ rbenv install 3.3.5
----
