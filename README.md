# ruby-build

ruby-build provides a simple way to compile and install different
versions of Ruby on UNIX-like systems.

### Installing ruby-build

    $ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git
    $ cd ruby-build
    $ ./install.sh

This will install ruby-build into `/usr/local`. If you do not have
write permission to `/usr/local`, you will need to run `sudo
./install.sh` instead. You can install to a different prefix by
setting the `PREFIX` environment variable.

### Installing Ruby

To install a Ruby version, run the `ruby-build` command with the path
to a definition file and the path where you want to install it. (A
number of [built-in
definitions](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/tree/master/share/ruby-build)
may be specified instead.)

    $ ruby-build 1.9.2-p290 ~/local/ruby-1.9.2-p290
    ...
    $ ~/local/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bin/ruby --version
    ruby 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09 revision 32553) [x86_64-darwin11.0.0]

You can use it with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv):

    $ ruby-build 1.9.2-p290 ~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.2-p290

ruby-build provides an `rbenv-install` command that shortens this to:

    $ rbenv install 1.9.2-p290

Once installed you have to rebuild the shim binaries. You should do 
this any time you install a new Ruby binary (for example, when 
installing a new Ruby version, or when installing a gem that provides 
a binary).

    $ rbenv rehash
