# ruby-build

ruby-build is an [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) plugin
that provides an `rbenv install` command to compile and install
different versions of Ruby on UNIX-like systems.

You can also use ruby-build without rbenv in environments where you
need precise control over Ruby version installation.


## Installation

### Installing as an rbenv plugin (recommended)

Installing ruby-build as an rbenv plugin will give you access to the
`rbenv install` command.

    git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build

This will install the latest development version of ruby-build into
the `~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build` directory. From that directory, you
can check out a specific release tag. To update ruby-build, run `git
pull` to download the latest changes.

### Installing as a standalone program (advanced)

Installing ruby-build as a standalone program will give you access to
the `ruby-build` command for precise control over Ruby version
installation. If you have rbenv installed, you will also be able to
use the `rbenv install` command.

    git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git
    cd ruby-build
    ./install.sh

This will install ruby-build into `/usr/local`. If you do not have
write permission to `/usr/local`, you will need to run `sudo
./install.sh` instead. You can install to a different prefix by
setting the `PREFIX` environment variable.

To update ruby-build after it has been installed, run `git pull` in
your cloned copy of the repository, then re-run the install script.

### Installing with Homebrew (for OS X users)

Mac OS X users can install ruby-build with the
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) package manager. This
will give you access to the `ruby-build` command. If you have rbenv
installed, you will also be able to use the `rbenv install` command.

*This is the recommended method of installation if you installed rbenv
 with Homebrew.*

    brew install ruby-build

Or, if you would like to install the latest development release:

    brew install --HEAD ruby-build


## Usage

### Using `rbenv install` with rbenv

To install a Ruby version for use with rbenv, run `rbenv install` with
the exact name of the version you want to install. For example,

    rbenv install 1.9.3-p286

Ruby versions will be installed into a directory of the same name
under `~/.rbenv/versions`.

To see a list of all available Ruby versions, run `rbenv install --list`.
You may also tab-complete available Ruby
versions if your rbenv installation is properly configured.

### Using `ruby-build` standalone

If you have installed ruby-build as a standalone program, you can use
the `ruby-build` command to compile and install Ruby versions into
specific locations.

Run the `ruby-build` command with the exact name of the version you
want to install and the full path where you want to install it. For
example,

    ruby-build 1.9.3-p286 ~/local/ruby-1.9.3-p286

To see a list of all available Ruby versions, run `ruby-build
--definitions`.

Pass the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to `ruby-build` as the first
argument to see what's happening under the hood.

Ruby 2 is incompatible with the version of OpenSSL bundled with Mac OS X, so it
doesn't compile the extension.

To work around this issue, install OpenSSL using homebrew instead:

    brew install openssl

Then set the CONFIGURE_OPTS environment variable when you build Ruby:

    CONFIGURE_OPTS=--with-openssl-dir=`brew --prefix openssl` rbenv install 2.0.0-preview1

### Custom definitions

Both `rbenv install` and `ruby-build` accept a path to a custom
definition file in place of a version name. Custom definitions let you
develop and install versions of Ruby that are not yet supported by
ruby-build.

See the [ruby-build built-in
definitions](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/tree/master/share/ruby-build)
as a starting point for custom definition files.

### Special environment variables

You can set certain environment variables to control the build
process.

* `TMPDIR` sets the location where ruby-build stores temporary files.
* `RUBY_BUILD_BUILD_PATH` sets the location in which sources are
  downloaded and built. By default, this is a subdirectory of
  `TMPDIR`.
* `CC` sets the path to the C compiler.
* `CONFIGURE_OPTS` lets you pass additional options to `./configure`.
* `MAKE_OPTS` (or `MAKEOPTS`) lets you pass additional options to
  `make`.

### Keeping the build directory after installation

Both `ruby-build` and `rbenv install` accept the `-k` or `--keep`
flag, which tells ruby-build to keep the downloaded source after
installation. This can be useful if you need to use `gdb` and
`memprof` with Ruby.

Source code will be kept in a parallel directory tree
`~/.rbenv/sources` when using `--keep` with the `rbenv install`
command. You should specify the location of the source code with the
`RUBY_BUILD_BUILD_PATH` environment variable when using `--keep` with
`ruby-build`.
